            Angular is a Javascript framework. This is one of the hot frameworks
            in Front End space & one of the most sort out skills in Toronto Tech
            arena. I spend a good 25-30 hours focusing on absolute fundamentals.
            Checkout the demo application you build & its details of the course if
            you are interested in knowing more. The course is ideal for beginner
            level people who is dipping their feet into front end space / back end
            devs who is looking to go full stack. I cover ES6 & Typescript
            fundamentals first before diving into Angular. Checkout the weekly topics covered below. To see the app we are build, check the live demo.

        React has become one of the most sought after library that is used in
        conjunction with other backend frameworks. The course has 2 parts and
        this is the first of two parts. The duration of part 1 is 15-18 hrs.
        Here, we learn react without the distractions of 3rd party libraries
        and complex state management rules. On part 2, we layer in the Redux
        and its associated libraries. But before that, it is important to
        learn what react is and what problems can it solve and why do we need
        to use other state management options. Checkout the weekly topics covered below.
